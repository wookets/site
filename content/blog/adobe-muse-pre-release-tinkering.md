Played around with Adobe Muse Pre-release 3 today.<br /><br />Result:&nbsp;<a href="http://wookets.com/code/adobe_muse/webarch/">http://wookets.com/code/adobe_muse/webarch/</a><br /><br />Pretty crummy. The site that I put together that is...<br /><br />Muse is pretty limited on options, which makes it pretty straight forward to use, but I'm leery of making anything professional with such a tool. It does the same thing as dreamweaver and spits out code at the end and if you need a feature which the Muse tool doesn't have... Pretty much too bad, because changing generated code will never be fun.<br /><br />One that that bothers me is you can't insert an image. You can copy one to the clipboard and paste it in, but that seems weird... But, again, it's pre-release and free.<br /><br />References:<br /><br /><a href="http://muse.adobe.com/">http://muse.adobe.com/</a>
