Pros:<br />- Streaming<br />- UI / Searching is extremely fast<br />- Can sync own music files<br /><br />Cons:<br />- No 'genius' mode custom playlists... Can't they make it so based on a song it loads a variety of music to create a playlist with new artists that I can find?<br />- The UI is cumbersome. A better album view would be nice. Unless you're searching their online database, everything revolves around playlists.<br />- I don't have any friends, can't it (spotify) perhaps recommend music for me based on my listening habits. Currently my inbox is zero.<br />- iPhone app keeps deleting my local / sync'd / offline files? Wtf? I'm assuming this has something to do with licensing or whatever where spotify needs to disable offline files if... whatever... it's annoying. no excuses.<br /><br />I don't know... Maybe I should just do iPhones match. As it stands, it's&nbsp;trifling&nbsp;painful to pay for a streaming service and have it be 96% of what you want, but still missing songs. It's like a half baked piece of bread. I don't want to go over here and over there. I just want everything under one roof. I assume iTunes will eventually add streaming? I'd pay $15 a month for iTunes streaming + $25 for iTunes match + app store still available to buy things w/ some type of genius, find new artists...
