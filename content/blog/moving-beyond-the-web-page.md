The barrier to entry for web development and systems configuration is so low that it is applicable to individuals with enough cognitive ability to process a work flow. That pool may be small, as many can't correctly comprehend their own work flow or the ideal. However, software architects will be whittled down, forced to join the engineers and scientists in becoming ever more engrained in fluid repeatable generic design patterns not just for a monitor or a website, but for a machine of specific utility.<br /><br />The desktop is dead. Thin laptops and tablets are here to stay. But what joins them? Phones certainly. I'm imagining eventually your phone or tablet will be sufficient to wirelessly power a workstation and specified points in your daily routine. But, those are the obvious devices. What else, what is the next hardware? When will we get hardware that doesn't require a screen to interface with? Hardware that is so natural and responsive that it works, it is easy, it is functional, it is aesthetic, it is powerful, it is efficient.<br /><br />The problem arises that the obvious deduction would lead to a robot. An entirely function generic device modeled after a human and thus can solve human problems.<br /><br />I'm left with looking at augmenting not the world around us with a device, but ourselves... Importing technology into our bodies. And, you can run with that...<br /><br />For knowledge is not enough... Application of knowledge is what is truly important...<br /><br />I am extremely interested to find out to what degree people&nbsp;requisite&nbsp;augmentation. Would it coalesce people into one frame or would it drive a scattershot of diversity in all directions. Would we in fact be augmented to fulfill our desired line of work (likely) or perhaps our vision for what the world should be (also likely)...<br /><br />Perhaps first we should work on muting violence. Equilibrium.<br /><br /><br />
