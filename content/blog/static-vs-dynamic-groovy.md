If you try groovy++, the results do bare out. And it will add static checking to your code inside of eclipse, which could be argued is more important than adding more servers.<br /><br />However, it looks like groovy is adding first class support for the functionality in 2.0. Though it seems static checking will be in first and the performance improvements will happen later.<br /><br />See the reference links below for the relevant blog posts. They provide a good read.<br /><br />I don't believe in the groovy purist claims that static checking is not wanted, nor needed. Groovy will die or languish in agony if it isn't improved. After all, look at Java. As Scala and Clojure and Groovy pick up steam, Java will be used in antique programs and applications that no one wants to convert and new things will hopefully be written in a more terse language.<br /><br /><b>References</b><br /><ul><li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/groovypptest/">http://code.google.com/p/groovypptest/</a></li><li><a href="http://stronglytypedblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/java-vs-scala-vs-groovy-vs-groovy.html">http://stronglytypedblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/java-vs-scala-vs-groovy-vs-groovy.html</a></li><li><a href="http://www.jroller.com/melix/entry/groovy_static_type_checker_status">http://www.jroller.com/melix/entry/groovy_static_type_checker_status</a></li></ul>
