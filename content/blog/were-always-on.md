Surely the title leads one to imagine the cliched notion that we are always connected or always 'powered' on, but I am in fact alluding to our brains always being on.<br /><br />It's likely that you've heard that humans used to work less back in the day than they do now. I guess that depends if you live in a garage without a job, but by and large if we look at the number of hours people put into their line of work, it certainly could be determined that it is more demanding. More and more we must always be on.<br /><br />A comparison would be that of the US demand for cheap goods. A person in China is willing to do far more work than a person in America and for less pay. It is cheaper to pay someone in China, put that product on a boat, sail it half way around the world, pay people on both shores to haul it on and off a boat, put it on a train or a truck and drive it an 1/8th across the globe, and into a store.
