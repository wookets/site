Useful if you just got a new mac with Lion installed and need to get subclipse up and running. Collabnet hasn't updated the SVN binaries to 10.7 yet. So a work around.<br /><br />"Open this file : sudo pico /System/Library/Core Services/SystemVersi on.plist change version to 10.6 wherever you see 10.7 install subversion change back to 10.7" (as taken from below)<br /><br /><br />Reference:<br /><br /><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6791989/subclipse-in-mac-os-lion">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6791989/subclipse-in-mac-os-lion</a>
