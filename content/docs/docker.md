### Overview

The official [docker website](https://www.docker.com/what-docker) gives you a good overview. More simply, docker also you to image your application and infrastructure and deploy it rapidly and repeatedly. This is done by creating an isolated environment (a container) that can run side-by-side with other containers on the same hardware. Think of containers as [Virtual Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) but without the resource hoginess / slowness. 

### Setup

[Downlaod Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) from the [Docker Store](https://store.docker.com/). You'll want to just grab the [community edition](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac). 

Once it finishes downloading, you'll drag it into applications as you normally would with other OSX applications. Command + Spacebar "Docker" should give you the docker.app once it is done indexing.

The main way to interact with Docker on OSX is via the flyout menu in the upper-right corner.

Of course, this install also installs the [Docker command line](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/).
