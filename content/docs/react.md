### Disclaimer

I had some [help](https://tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide-to-building-apps-with-react/).

### Overview

React is a library for building user interfaces. Specifically the "view" portion of the [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) (model-view-controller) pattern. React is typically coupled with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) or another [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html) like pattern. 

While many previous UI libraries did their best to separate presentation (html) from code (javascript), react actually goes all in on have javascript (and its own extension [jsx](https://jsx.github.io/)) build the UI.
