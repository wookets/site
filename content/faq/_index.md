## What development tools do you use? 

I'm always trying new ones, but have taken to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac/). I will randomly run Git commands in CLI. Of course, [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is best for iOS development if you aren't using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) or [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/).

## What is a wove?

Like a cove, but more of a web-based one. 

## Why don't you write about ___ code or technology?

The hours of the day limit how much one person can produce. 

## Why did you make this site? 

Because showing is more important than saying.
